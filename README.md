Markov-bot
=
Markov chains are written in Java.

Written in Kotlin. Just run `mvn package` to get it to compile. Use `java -classpath target/markov-bot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar edu.appstate.cs.MarkovBot` to run it. Getting executable jars is on the TODO list.

A few TODOs:
* [ ] Multiple server support
* [ ] Multithreaded markov chain saving
* [ ] Add main class to the compiled jar so we can just use `java -jar target/markov-bot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
